Create class that contains the order of the headers and data, as well as which rdt to utilize
can this class be reused between the client and server?

deliberately alter the data to be sent when testing which version is more reliable

therefore include a way of testing which packets were not sent properly and needed to be resent
(the server will output the errors encountered, while as the client displays data)

server delivers data from a queue (utilize string for testing, look into outputting and sending audio, video, string)

look into creating a "connection" between client and server in the fashion of TCP (look at the difference)
    allows for queueing data that could not be sent because previous data needed to be resent
    
since each "connection" with a client must have its own reliability checks, because different packets may be sent or not, a list of all clients connected must be created

the client replies 

the initial message sent from the client to the server receives its ip address and port number.
the client then sends data where the client replies with acknowledgements

how to seperate the reliability features
    by the book:
        rdt: 1.0 - A protocol for a completely reliable channel
        rdt: 2.0 - A protocol for a channel with bit errors
        rdt: 2.1 - A protocol for retransmission check
        rdt: 2.2 - Reliable Data Transfer over a Lossy Channel with Bit Errors
        
        is future levels built on previous levels?
